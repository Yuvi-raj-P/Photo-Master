Welcome to Photomaster a web based image editing platform with basic but key features. The editor also works offline when downloaded as there are no libraries used and everything is completely written from scratch.
More feature except from crop, filters, and rotate have been worked for example warp, skew transform, paint, and text but were not added to this yet due to bugs and problems with other features.

Code is formatted by prettier and refactored by AI for better readability, consistency, and concise code. Icons are from Icon8.com
